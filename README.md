## Getting Started

### SDK Configuration

To begin making calls to the Asista API, you need to register an application on the [Asista Developer Site](https://asista.com/developer) and get credentials for your app.

Then, configure your Xcode with information for the Asista SDK. Locate the **Info.plist** file for your application. Right-click this file and select **Open As > Source Code**

Add the following code snippet, replacing the placeholders within the square brackets (`[]`) with your appâ€™s information from the developer dashboard. (Note: Do not include the square brackets)

```
<key>Asista</key>
<dict>
<key>appKey</key>
<string>[appKey]</string>
<key>appSecret</key>
<string>[appSecret]</string>
<key>tenantUrl</key>
<string>[https://yourdomain.asista.com]</string>
</dict>
```
